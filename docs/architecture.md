# ForestryFIVE Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the microservices architecture of the ForestryFIVE online course platform, designed for scalability, security, and maintainability.

## Architecture Diagram
[Placeholder for architecture diagram]
- **User Service**: Handles authentication, user profiles, and roles.
- **Course Service**: Manages course content, structure, and delivery.
- **Notification Service**: Sends emails and in-app notifications.
- **Analytics Service**: Tracks user engagement and platform metrics.
- **Frontend**: React.js application for student and instructor interfaces.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Separate interface for platform administrators.

## Data Flow
1. **User Interaction**: Users interact via the frontend, which communicates with the API Gateway.
2. **API Gateway**: Routes requests to appropriate microservices.
3. **Service Communication**: Microservices communicate synchronously via REST/gRPC and asynchronously via Kafka/RabbitMQ.
4. **Data Storage**: Services store data in respective databases (PostgreSQL for structured, MongoDB for content, Redis for caching, Elasticsearch for search).
5. **Media Delivery**: Course content like videos is stored in cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3) and delivered via CDN.

## Microservices Communication Patterns
- **Synchronous**: REST for user-facing, gRPC for internal.
- **Asynchronous**: Kafka for event-driven actions (e.g., enrollment, certificate issuance).
- **Saga Pattern**: Choreography for distributed transactions.
- **CQRS**: Separate read/write models for scalability.

## Security
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 with OpenID Connect.
- **Authorization**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
- **Encryption**: TLS for data in transit, AES-256 for data at rest.

## Scalability and Resilience
- **Load Balancing**: AWS ALB or NGINX.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Kubernetes auto-scaling.
- **Circuit Breakers**: Resilience4j for fault tolerance.
- **Data Partitioning**: Sharding by user/course ID.

Further details on each component will be added as the system design evolves.
